# Hi there, I'm Syntax! 👋  

I make cool stuff. Sometimes people think it’s awesome. 🚀  

You might know me as:  
- A **Python Programmer**, creating HTML and Python-based web applications, along with creating a variety of tools, including advanced utilities that can serve both constructive and critical purposes.
- A **verified HTML and Python programmer**.  
- The founder of **Cyber Protectors**, a chill and ethical coding/gaming community.  

Maybe you’ve seen me in **Discord Central** 🌐—an unofficial Discord coding community I proudly founded in **2020** 🛠️. It’s a hub for developers, coders, and tech enthusiasts to connect, create, and collaborate! 🎮✨
